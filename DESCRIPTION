Description: Implements a two-stage procedure based on fast node-wise penalized regression (lasso and elastic net) to identify genomic factors that regulating biological networks. Stage 1 involves estimating the biological network using Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) while stage 2 involves identifying genomic factors that regulate edges of the biological network. Both stages accounts for bias-corrected false-positives and FDR-based tuning selection.
