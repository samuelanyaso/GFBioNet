Identifying High-Dimensional Genomic Factors Associated with Biological Networks

Two-stage approach: 
1. Estimate a base network without genomic factors;
2. Identify genomic factors that modify network edges.
   
Both steps use penalized node-wise regression for estimation. An innovative permutation-based approach is introduced for accurate false discovery rate (FDR) control.
